This is a ReactJs program to count button clicks and show the counts of button clicks in a chart. 

How to play:
1) Select time period (5s, 10s, 30s) to count button clicks.
2) Click the left or right button randomly during your selected time period.
3) When time is up, the two buttons will become disabled and count of button clicks will be shown in a multiline chart.
