This is a ReactJs program to count button clicks and show the counts in a chart. 

The CanvasJs Mulit-series Chart is used to display chart. 

How to play:
1) Select duration (5s, 10s, 30s) to count button clicks.
2) Click left or right buttons randomly during your selected time period.
3) When time is up, the two buttons will become disabled and a chart will be displayed to show count of button clicks in each unit time.
